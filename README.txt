Note: While creating the neaural network, I have adapted the code in Michael Nielsen's 'Neural Networks and Deep Learning' book.

Note: There are comment lines in the code describing the structure of the model.

Note: In the first section, the model has been created without the use of any ML libraries. In the second part, the same model is created and evaluated with TensorFlow library.
